-- Student Grades Manager (lecture_4)
-- Schema definition, sample data and analysis queries for school.db.

-- 1. Create tables

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    birth_year INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS grades (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    subject TEXT NOT NULL,
    grade INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (grade BETWEEN 1 AND 100),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
);

-- 2. Insert data

INSERT INTO students (id, full_name, birth_year) VALUES
    (1, 'Alice Johnson', 2005),
    (2, 'Brian Smith', 2004),
    (3, 'Carla Reyes', 2006),
    (4, 'Daniel Kim', 2005),
    (5, 'Eva Thompson', 2003),
    (6, 'Felix Nguyen', 2007),
    (7, 'Grace Patel', 2005),
    (8, 'Henry Lopez', 2004),
    (9, 'Isabella Martinez', 2006);

INSERT INTO grades (student_id, subject, grade) VALUES
    (1, 'Math', 88),
    (1, 'English', 92),
    (1, 'Science', 85),

    (2, 'Math', 75),
    (2, 'History', 83),
    (2, 'English', 79),

    (3, 'Science', 95),
    (3, 'Math', 91),
    (3, 'Art', 89),

    (4, 'Math', 84),

    (5, 'Math', 88),

    (6, 'Science', 72),
    (6, 'Math', 78),
    (6, 'English', 81),

    (7, 'Art', 94),
    (7, 'Science', 87),
    (7, 'Math', 90),

    (8, 'Science', 80),

    (9, 'English', 96),
    (9, 'Math', 89),
    (9, 'Art', 92);

-- 3. Find all grades for a specific student (Alice Johnson).

SELECT
    s.full_name,
    g.subject,
    g.grade
FROM students AS s
JOIN grades AS g ON g.student_id = s.id
WHERE s.full_name = 'Alice Johnson';

-- 4. Calculate the average grade per student.

SELECT
    s.full_name,
    AVG(g.grade) AS average_grade
FROM students AS s
LEFT JOIN grades AS g ON g.student_id = s.id
GROUP BY s.id, s.full_name;

-- 5. List all students born after 2004.

SELECT
    full_name,
    birth_year
FROM students
WHERE birth_year > 2004
ORDER BY birth_year, full_name;

-- 6. List all subjects and their average grades.

SELECT
    subject,
    AVG(grade) AS average_grade
FROM grades
GROUP BY subject
ORDER BY subject;

-- 7. Find the top 3 students with the highest average grades.

SELECT
    s.full_name,
    AVG(g.grade) AS average_grade
FROM students AS s
JOIN grades AS g ON g.student_id = s.id
GROUP BY s.id, s.full_name
ORDER BY average_grade DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- 8. Show all students who have scored below 80 in any subject.

SELECT DISTINCT
    s.full_name
FROM students AS s
JOIN grades AS g ON g.student_id = s.id
WHERE g.grade < 80
ORDER BY s.full_name;

-- Optional indexes to optimize queries.

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_grades_student_id
    ON grades (student_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_grades_subject
    ON grades (subject);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_students_birth_year
    ON students (birth_year);
